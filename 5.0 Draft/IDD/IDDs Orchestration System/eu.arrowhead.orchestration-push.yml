  title: Push Orchestration Service
  description: |
    The push Orchestration service allows for systems to load System of systems (SoS) configurations into another systems. 
    This allows to load service consumption directives remotely into systems to perform a task. 

    If no configuration is specified in the triggering message, the active configuration on the orchestrator will be pushed
    into the target system. SoS Configurations are expressed as a series of orchestration rules, and represent desired SoS states
    for specific tasks. 

    An _orchestration rule_ connects a specified _provider_ providing a _service_ with a _consumer_. This means that the 
    _consumer_ is adviced to consume the _service_, prefferably from the listed _provider_. Additional matching metadata
    can be specified as part of the orchestration rule.

    Address:
      description: |
        Identifies a _transport_ and a _location_.

        The _transport_ identifies the base protocol that facilitates addressing a specific service
        instance. Examples of transports that can be supported are `tcp4`, `tcp6`, `udp4`, `udp6`
        and `unix`. A protocol only counts as a transport if it both (A) provides a way of
        addressing and, by extension, sending messages to service providers and consumers, as well
        as (B) does not build upon another protocol also providing this capability. I other words,
        TLS and DTLS are _not_ transports, because they build upon the TCP and UDP protocols, which
        satisfy condition A.

        What the _location_ part consists of depends on what transport is identified. If the
        transport is `tcp4` or `udp4`, the location is an IPv4 address expressed as four decimal
        numbers separated by dots, a colon and a port number, such as in `192.168.3.22:64075`. If
        the transport is `tcp6` or `udp6`, the location is an IPv6 address, rendered as described in
        [RFC 5952](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5952), within square brackets, followed by a
        colon and a port number. If the transport is `unix`, the location is an absolute filesystem
        path to a Unix socket file.
      type: string
      pattern: ^(?<transport>[^:]+):\w*(?<location>.*)$
      example: tcp4:192.168.0.7:45326

        Additional details of relevance when consuming a service. What metadata is made available
        depends on the type of the service holding the metadata. Possible examples of metadata are
        HTTP base paths, message size restrictions and caching directives.
