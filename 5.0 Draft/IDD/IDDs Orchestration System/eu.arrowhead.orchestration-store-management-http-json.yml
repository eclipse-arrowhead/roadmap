  title: Orchestration Management API
  description: |
    This API defines interfaces to interact with the Orchestration store where Orchestration rules and Sos configurations
    are stored. 

    An _orchestration rule_ connects a specified _provider_ providing a _service_ with a _consumer_. This means that the 
    _consumer_ is adviced to consume the _service_, prefferably from the listed _provider_. Additional matching metadata
    can be specified as part of the orchestration rule. 

    The orchestration store has also the capability of storing system of systems (SoS) configurations. These configurations
    are expressed as a series of orchestration rules, and represent desired SoS states for specific tasks. Configurations can
    be stored and retrieved using the described interfaces in this document. Moreover, active configurations for a local cloud
    can be defined using the _active-configuration_ endpoint. The active configuration is used by the orchestration to 
    provide orchestration responses to consumers. 

    When setting active configurations, a time-to-live parameter can be defined to specify for how long the specific configuration
    is valid in the local cloud.
