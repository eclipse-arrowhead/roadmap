  title: Authorization HTTP(S)-JSON
  description: |
    This specification outlines how to realize the _Arrowhead Core Authorization_ service on top of
    either of the HTTP or HTTPS protocols with payloads encoded in JSON. This service allows for
    _resource_ ownwers to check _access-rights_ of _subjects_ attempting to perform operations over
    their protected _resources_. Authorization queries are then made in the form of the _triple_
    (subject, access-right, resource). In the context of service consumption authorization,
    service providers act as resource owners for their provideded services (or _resources_), while 
    consumers are _subjects_ trying to apply their _access right_ to consume a service. For such 
    application, an authorization query shall look as:

      subject: "MWtzOXIpaUEsOyEhc1NsTwo="
      access-right: "consume"
      resource: "/OutsideTemp"

    In the context of this document, we understand an _access-right_ to be a string identifier that
    names something a subject can request that a certain type of service performs on its behalf. We
    also understand an _resource_ to be any kind resource that is acted upon while an operation is
    performed. If, for example, a file storage service is provided, then possible _access-right_ could
    be `"upload"` and `"download"` while the _resource_ of the service are the files it stores.

    No requirements are imposed on an implementation of this service with regards to how it
    determines if certain subjects are allowed to perform certain access rights on certain resources.
    It may implement something akin to the INCITS 565-2020 standard, also known as _Next Generation_
    _Access Control_ (NGAC), or something much less sophisticated. It is also assumed that the
    service provider is informed about what authorization requests to approve via some other service
    than this one.

    ## Caching and Performance

    Implementations of this service _may_ allow for its consumers to cache its authorization
    decisions for brief periods of time when relevant to improve performance. When it is enabled, it
    is communicated via the `Cache-Control` header of its responses.

    An individual implementation of this service with sufficiently sophisticated software and
    hardware should be able to handle up to and beyond hundreds of thousands of authorization
    triplets per second. That being said, there could be cases where no available hardware is
    performant enough, or where individual consumers are disconnected from this service for
    significant periods of time. These use cases are outside the scope of this service.

    ## Compression and Language

    An implementation of this service interface _should_ be designed to support compression and
    _may_ provide human-readable error texts in different languages than English, as described in
    [RFC 9110, Section 12](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-content-negotiation). Not
    using compression _must_ be supported and _should_ be the default. Also, the default language
    for error messages _must_ be American English (`en-US`).

    ## Size Limits

    As a mitigation against denial-of-service attacks, all implementations of this service
    interface _should_ reject incoming requests that are larger than a predefined limit. That limit
    _must not_ be smaller than 8192 bytes for each received request. An implementation _may_ also
    limit the sizes of individual parts within each request. It _must_, however, receive request
    payloads up to 4096 bytes in size. If payload compression is supported, then this limit applies
    after decompression.

        If present, the value of this header may only include the `max-age`, `must-revalidate` and

        [RFC 9111 Section 5.2.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9111#name-response-directives).

        The `max-age` directive indicates for how many seconds the decision in the response may be
        cached before being requested again by the subject. The `must-revalidate` directive is used
        to forbid the subject from using the decision after the `max-age` has expired and the
        attempt to request it again failed. The `no-store` directive instructs the subject not to
        cache the decision at all.

    Address:
      description: |
        Identifies a _transport_ and a _location_.

        The _transport_ identifies the base protocol that facilitates addressing a specific service
        instance. Examples of transports that can be supported are `tcp4`, `tcp6`, `udp4`, `udp6`
        and `unix`. A protocol only counts as a transport if it both (A) provides a way of
        addressing and, by extension, sending messages to service providers and consumers, as well
        as (B) does not build upon another protocol also providing this capability. I other words,
        TLS and DTLS are _not_ transports, because they build upon the TCP and UDP protocols, which
        satisfy condition A.

        What the _location_ part consists of depends on what transport is identified. If the
        transport is `tcp4` or `udp4`, the location is an IPv4 address expressed as four decimal
        numbers separated by dots, a colon and a port number, such as in `192.168.3.22:64075`. If
        the transport is `tcp6` or `udp6`, the location is an IPv6 address, rendered as described in
        [RFC 5952](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5952), within square brackets, followed by a
        colon and a port number. If the transport is `unix`, the location is an absolute filesystem
        path to a Unix socket file.
      type: string
      pattern: ^(?<transport>[^:]+):\w*(?<location>.*)$
      example: tcp4:192.168.0.7:45326
