  title: Service Registry Management API
  description: |
    This specification outlines how to use the _Arrowhead Service Registry Administration_ service
    on top of either of the HTTP or HTTPS protocols with payloads encoded in JASON. The service allows for 
    service providers or cloud administrators to list, register, or unregister services from the service
    registry catalog. To register a service, the service provider, a system administrator, or a supporting system
    must fill a _ServiceEntry_  object with the details of the service and the service provider. Additional 
    inforation can be especified in the _metadata_ parameter. 

    ## Compression and Language

    An implementation of this service interface _may_ be designed to support compression and/or
    human-readable error texts in different languages than English, as described in 
    [RFC 9110, Section 12](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-content-negotiation). Not
    using compression _must_ be supported and be the default. Also, the default language for error
    messages _must_ be American English (`en-US`).

    ## Managing Record Life-Cycles

    In a typical use case, this service interface is meant to hold records for all service providers
    currently part of its context. When a service provider joins or leaves a context, it is expected
    to register and deregister its services, respectively. However, service providers can fail or be
    detached from the context before they get a chance to deregister their services. This can make
    it relevant to monitor service providers and temporarily suppress or permanently prune records
    associated with unhealthy or inaccessible providers. Implementations of this service interface
    are free to suppress and/or prune records in whatever way best supports the use cases they are
    designed for.

    ## Record Ownership

    It is the provider indicated inside each record that is the owner of the record, and not the
    consumer registering it. This means that a consumer may be forbidden from registering or
    deregistering a record for certain or all other service providers, even if it may register
    and/or deregister records with itself as provider.

    ## Provider Identifiers

    Every service instance registered via this service interface _must_ be associated with a unique
    identifier. In contexts where authentication is not used, providers _must_ chose their own
    identifiers. Those identifiers _should_ remain consistent between restarts of those providers.

    ## Size Limits

    As a mitigation against denial-of-service attacks, all implementations of this service
    interface _should_ reject incoming requests that are larger than a predefined limit. That limit
    _must not_ be smaller than 8192 bytes for each received request. An implementation _may_ also
    limit the sizes of individual parts within each request. It _must_, however, receive request
    URI:s up to 2816 bytes in size, as well as request payloads up to 4096 bytes in size.

    Address:
      description: |
        Identifies a _transport_ and a _location_.

        The _transport_ identifies the base protocol that facilitates addressing a specific service
        instance. Examples of transports that can be supported are `tcp4`, `tcp6`, `udp4`, `udp6`
        and `unix`. A protocol only counts as a transport if it both (A) provides a way of
        addressing and, by extension, sending messages to service providers and consumers, as well
        as (B) does not build upon another protocol also providing this capability. I other words,
        TLS and DTLS are _not_ transports, because they build upon the TCP and UDP protocols, which
        satisfy condition A.

        What the _location_ part consists of depends on what transport is identified. If the
        transport is `tcp4` or `udp4`, the location is an IPv4 address expressed as four decimal
        numbers separated by dots, a colon and a port number, such as in `192.168.3.22:64075`. If
        the transport is `tcp6` or `udp6`, the location is an IPv6 address, rendered as described in
        [RFC 5952](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5952), within square brackets, followed by a
        colon and a port number. If the transport is `unix`, the location is an absolute filesystem
        path to a Unix socket file.
      type: string
      pattern: ^(?<transport>[^:]+):\w*(?<location>.*)$
      example: tcp4:192.168.0.7:45326
