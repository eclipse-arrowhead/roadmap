  title: Service Discovery HTTP(S)-JSON
  description: |
    This specification outlines how to realize the _Arrowhead Core Service Discovery_ service on
    top of either of the HTTP or HTTPS protocols with payloads encoded in JSON. The service allows
    for consumers to register, deregister and search for _service records_, provided by themselves
    or by other service providers.
    
    Each service record represents a currently provided service and contains all details necessary
    to _contact_ that service. Such details will always include network addresses and a _service_
    _type identifier_, apart from other optional information. The service type identifier is a
    reference to the particular message protocol implemented by the provided service. Such a
    protocol typically builds upon a base protocol, such as HTTP or MQTT, and includes endpoints,
    topics or other operators, as well as message types specific to the provided service. For the
    consumption of the service referred to by a service record to be possible, the consumer in
    question must already implement the protocol referred to by its service type identifier.

   
    ## Compression and Language

    An implementation of this service interface _may_ be designed to support compression and/or
    human-readable error texts in different languages than English, as described in 
    [RFC 9110, Section 12](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-content-negotiation). Not
    using compression _must_ be supported and be the default. Also, the default language for error
    messages _must_ be American English (`en-US`).

    ## Managing Record Life-Cycles

    In a typical use case, this service interface is meant to hold records for all service providers
    currently part of its context. When a service provider joins or leaves a context, it is expected
    to register and deregister its services, respectively. However, service providers can fail or be
    detached from the context before they get a chance to deregister their services. This can make
    it relevant to monitor service providers and temporarily suppress or permanently prune records
    associated with unhealthy or inaccessible providers. Implementations of this service interface
    are free to suppress and/or prune records in whatever way best supports the use cases they are
    designed for.

    ## Record Ownership

    It is the provider indicated inside each record that is the owner of the record, and not the
    consumer registering it. This means that a consumer may be forbidden from registering or
    deregistering a record for certain or all other service providers, even if it may register
    and/or deregister records with itself as provider.

    ## Provider Identifiers

    Every service instance registered via this service interface _must_ be associated with a unique
    identifier. In contexts where authentication is not used, providers _must_ chose their own
    identifiers. Those identifiers _should_ remain consistent between restarts of those providers.
    In contexts where authentication is used, the identifier _must_ be derived as follows: TODO.

    ## Size Limits

    As a mitigation against denial-of-service attacks, all implementations of this service
    interface _should_ reject incoming requests that are larger than a predefined limit. That limit
    _must not_ be smaller than 8192 bytes for each received request. An implementation _may_ also
    limit the sizes of individual parts within each request. It _must_, however, receive request
    URI:s up to 2816 bytes in size, as well as request payloads up to 4096 bytes in size.

        [RFC 9111 Section 5.2.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9111#name-response-directives).

        The `max-age` directive indicates for how many seconds the records in the response should be
        cached before being queried again by the consumer. The `must-revalidate` directive is used
        to forbid the consumer from using the records after the `max-age` has expired and the
        attempt to fetch them again failed. The `no-store` directive instructs the consumer not to
        cache the records at all.

        Multiple expressions can be used to compose a filter string. These expressions can be connected with Boolean operators

    Address:
      description: |
        Identifies a _transport_ and a _location_.

        The _transport_ identifies the base protocol that facilitates addressing a specific service
        instance. Examples of transports that can be supported are `tcp4`, `tcp6`, `udp4`, `udp6`
        and `unix`. A protocol only counts as a transport if it both (A) provides a way of
        addressing and, by extension, sending messages to service providers and consumers, as well
        as (B) does not build upon another protocol also providing this capability. I other words,
        TLS and DTLS are _not_ transports, because they build upon the TCP and UDP protocols, which
        satisfy condition A.

        What the _location_ part consists of depends on what transport is identified. If the
        transport is `tcp4` or `udp4`, the location is an IPv4 address expressed as four decimal
        numbers separated by dots, a colon and a port number, such as in `192.168.3.22:64075`. If
        the transport is `tcp6` or `udp6`, the location is an IPv6 address, rendered as described in
        [RFC 5952](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5952), within square brackets, followed by a
        colon and a port number. If the transport is `unix`, the location is an absolute filesystem
        path to a Unix socket file.
      type: string
      pattern: ^(?<transport>[^:]+):\w*(?<location>.*)$
      example: tcp4:192.168.0.7:45326

    DeregisterExpression:
      description: |
        An expression of facts about a set of service records to deregister. A deregister expression
        consists of two parts, a _service part_ and a _provider part_. At least one of the two must
        be part of the query, or it will always match zero records.

        The parts are identical to those with the same names part of the `QueryExpression`. Please
        refer to its documentation for more details about their structure.
      type: string
      pattern: ^(?:(?<type>[^!*,:@^~]+)(?:~(?<version>\d+(?:\.\d+(?:\.\d+)?)?))?)?(?:@(?<provider>[A-Za-z0-9-_]*={0,2}))?$

    QueryExpression:
      description: |
        An expression of facts about a desired set of service records. A query expression consists
        of three parts, a _service part_, a _provider part_ and a _limit part_. At least one of the 
        two former parts must be part of the query, or it will always match zero records.

        The __service part__ must at least name a specific service type, but may also include a
        version specifier. If given, the version specifier will match records with any other version
        that is _compatible_ with it. A version specifier consist of a MAJOR, MINOR and a PATCH
        number, separated by dots. If both or the latter of the MINOR and PATCH numbers are omitted
        from a given version, the ones omitted are assumed to be zero. A given version is compatible
        with a _candidate_ version if their MAJOR numbers are equal and the MINOR number of the
        candidate version is greater than that of the given version. They are also compatible if
        their MAJOR and MINOR numbers are equal and the PATCH number of the candidate version is
        equal to or greater than that of the given version. For example, the query expression
        `my-service~1.4` matches `my-service~1.4.1` and `my-service~1.6.5`. But it does not match
        `my-service~1.3.9` or `my-service~2.0.4`.

        The __provider part__ limits matches to records that refer to the identified service
        provider.

        The __limit part__ sets a limit on how many matching records to include in the response. It
        consists of an asterisk followed by a positive integer, as in `a-service~1.0*4`.
